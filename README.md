# Instructions

This directory contains HTML source file ```Free Programming Ebooks - O'Reilly Media.html``` and assets from O'Reilly's Free Programming Ebooks page at http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/ as at 10 Jan 2018 08:54pm.

Your task is as follows:

1. Write a Jupyter Notebook or a R Markdown/Notebook document to scrape the HTML source file and useful data of all the free books that O'Reilly has made available. For Python, you can use the BeautifulSoup library. For R, you can use a combination of RCurl and XML or something like rvest. You are also free to use whatever libraries you are comfortable with. Save the data as a single CSV file named ```oreilly-free-books.csv```.
2. Add a narrative or story to your document and describe the data in the CSV file. This can include things like a count of all Python books or a list of books about containers or microservices.
3. Bonus: Add some visuals to make your document engaging and informative.

# Submission

To submit your assignment, commit your script(s), Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown document and the CSV file back into the repository.

# Notes
While I was able to scrap the website, I was unable to fine-tune the details further due to time constraints.
My original plan was to scrap, classify each book such as Java, Python for easier reference
